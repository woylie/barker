/**
 * This module forwards the variables for the design tokens and defines
 * additional variables.
 *
 * The variables forwarded from the token definitions have CSS custom properties
 * as values. This way, the final CSS output will use custom properties, but
 * you have the additional safety that unknown variables will result in a
 * build failure.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *    @use "../tokens" as t;
 *
 *    .my-component {
 *      color: t.$color-text-default;
 *    }
 *
 * Alternatively, use the accessor functions defined in _functions.scss.
