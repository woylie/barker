/**
 * This folder contains reusable components. Each component should be isolated
 * and only concerned about its own styling. The relationship of components to
 * its siblings should be handled by layouts.
 *
 * The styles of a component should be scoped by a single class. Modifier
 * classes should be named `is-*` or `has-*` (not `are-*` or `have-*`).
